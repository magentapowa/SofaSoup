# ___Welcome to SofaSoup
____________________________________________________________________
SofaSoup is about bringing people together through music.

Musician or not, you can come here to find or post events about jam sessions.
We focus mainly on jam sessions organised at private properties(houses, yards, garages), 
hence the `Sofa`. That is because we want to preserve that authentic feeling of
unrehearsed, improvised and on-the-spot musical creative process.

Events from all sides of the music spectrum are welcome. A bunch of people that get together 
with their instruments to jam. Saxophones, guitars, keyboards they are all welcome, hence the 
`Soup`, if it makes a sound you can bring it.
